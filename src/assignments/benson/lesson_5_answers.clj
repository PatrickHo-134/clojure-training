  "Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the 
   approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an 
   efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. 
   Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic â€“ every 
   feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides 
   easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, 
   to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection. 
   
   Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy
   and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming
   language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. 
   When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory 
   system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
   
   I hope you find Clojure's combination of facilities elegant, powerful, practical 
   and fun to use.
